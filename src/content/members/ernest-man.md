description: An innovative and resourceful professional with an MSc in Computing, with the ability to work using my own initiative and as part of a team. I have also led software development teams on a number of high profile projects. My experience in working with a wide range of commercial projects has given me the skills necessary to both adapt and grow to any development challenge.

  I specialise in Azure, DevOps and O365, helping companies to achieve specific goals such as designing and building complex solutions and CI/CD pipelines.
